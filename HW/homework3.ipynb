    "Physicists often fit for signals in the presence of background.  In such cases, the significance of the fitted signal depends not only on the number of signal events but also on the amount of background and our ability to statistically separate the two.  In this problem, we will explore fitting signal and background for a very simple case:  The signal is a Gaussian peak centered at $x=10$ with a width $\\sigma=1$ and the background is uniformly distributed between $x=0$ and $x=20$.  The code below generates fake data, allowing you to change both the number of events in the signal and the ratio of signal-to-background.  To make sure that our definition of background does not depend on the fit range, the code below defines the signal-to-background ratio as the ratio number of signal events to the number of background events in a $\\pm 2 \\sigma$ window around the signal peak.  Here is the code you will use to generate the fake data:"
