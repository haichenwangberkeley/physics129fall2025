Label each incoming and outgoing leg with the particle species and momentum (call incoming particle momenta $p_1$ and $p_2$ and outgoing particle momenta $p_3$ and $p_4$. Using the rules shown on page 124 of Thomson, mark each external line, internal propagator and vertex with the appropriate factor.  make sure your external lines have arrows indicating  whether the line represents a particle or an antiparticle.
