When a muon passes through the detector, it deposits about **$X$ electrons** (you get $X$ from the previous problem) through ionization. These electrons are assumed to be distributed **uniformly** within a horizontal interval of width **75 μm** (±37.5 μm) centered on the muon’s incident position $x_{\\text{in}}$.  \n\nThe detector strips collect charge in proportion to the overlap between their width and the ionization cloud. The readout system has two possible modes:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Binary Readout\n- A strip only registers a hit if it collects more than **600 electrons**.  \n- If only one strip registers, the measured position is taken as the **center of that strip**.  \n- If two strips register, the measured position is taken as the **midpoint between the two strips** (the boundary).  \n\n**Task:**  \nUsing a Monte Carlo simulation with hits generated at random $x_{\\text{in}}$ uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 cm, estimate the resolution of the measured position (the standard deviation of $x_{\\text{measured}} - x_{\\text{true}}$).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Analog Readout (TOT-like)\n- Same threshold of **600 electrons** applies.  \n- Each strip that passes threshold also records a charge measurement (time over threshold, TOT).  \n- The TOT digitization allows **22 discrete values** (0–21), with each step corresponding to **1000 electrons**. For example:  \n  - 15,069 electrons → TOT = 15  \n  - 23,432 electrons → TOT = 21 (saturation).  \n- The reconstructed hit position is:  \n  - **Center of the strip** if only one strip fires.  \n  - **Charge-weighted centroid** if two strips fire:  \n    $$\n    x_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{Q_1 x_1 + Q_2 x_2}{Q_1 + Q_2},\n    $$\n    where $Q_i$ are the measured charges after digitization and $x_i$ are the strip centers.  \n\n**Task:**  \nUsing the same Monte Carlo simulation procedure, estimate the resolution of the analog readout system.  \n\n---\n\n## Overall Goal\n- Implement a Monte Carlo simulation where:  \n  - Each event generates a random true hit position $x_{\\text{in}}$.  \n  - The ionization electrons are distributed uniformly in a 75 μm interval around $x_{\\text{in}}$.  \n  - Charges are collected by strips based on overlap and processed according to the binary or analog readout rules.  \n- Compare the resolutions obtained in the two cases.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"ffe35e1b-c94f-4c9f-9cfb-f6562cd79516","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hints:\n### Strategy\nI would try to do this in four steps:\n\n1. **Truth:** generate random hit positions within a strip region.  \n2. **Charge deposit:** calculate the number of electrons collected in each strip from the uniform ionization cloud.  \n3. **Measurement:** reconstruct the hit position using binary or analog readout rules.  \n4. **Resolution:** compute residuals $(x_\\text{measured} - x_\\text{true})$ and extract the standard deviation.  \n\nThese four steps are analogous to event generation, detector simulation, event reconstruction, and analysis, a typical computation workflow in collider data analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Plots to Produce\nTo help you understand if your simulation makes sense, produce the following plots as sanity checks:\n\n1. **Truth positions**  \n   - Histogram of the generated hit positions.  \n\n2. **Deposited electrons**  \n   - Distributions of the collected charge in strip 1 and strip 2.  \n\n3. **Measured vs. truth**  \n   - Scatter plot showing reconstructed vs true positions (for binary readout).  \n\n4. **Residuals**  \n   - Histograms of $(x_\\text{measured} - x_\\text{true})$ for binary and analog readout.  \n   - Quote the standard deviation of each distribution as the resolution.  \n","metadata":{}},{"id":"1be098e9-08f6-4d5c-9723-36fefb6352e6","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Your answer","metadata":{}},{"id":"b59b52b8-8377-4fdb-8f44-9728b4378200","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### AI Technology Disclosure Statement\n\nUse of AI technology is **permissible only** for:  \n- Formatting answers (e.g., converting to Markdown or LaTeX)  \n- Assisting with coding tasks (e.g., syntax help, debugging)  \n\nStudents must explicitly state **whether AI technology was used** in completing this homework.  \n- If **yes**, describe **how** it was used.  \n- If **no**, state that no AI technology was used.  \n\n⚠️ If this disclosure is missing, the homework **will not be graded**.  \nIf it is later completed, the submission will be treated as **late**.","metadata":{}},{"id":"0a659cc6-18da-4bf7-9641-1e7dca0b1f2c","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Your answer","metadata":{}}]}
