    "In high-energy physics, it is common to work in **natural units**.  \n",
    "The idea is to set the fundamental constants\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hbar = 1, \\quad c = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that energy, momentum, and mass all share the same units (typically GeV).  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why do this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplifies equations**  \n",
    "   For example, Einstein’s relation\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   when $c=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistent units**  \n",
    "   - Mass, energy, and momentum are all measured in GeV.  \n",
    "   - Lengths and times are expressed in inverse energy units, e.g.  \n",
    "     $1\\,\\text{GeV}^{-1} \\approx 0.197\\,\\text{fm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Makes scaling clearer**  \n",
    "   You immediately see how quantities depend on energy without carrying around constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restoring constants**  \n",
    "If needed, you can reinsert $\\hbar$ and $c$ for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handy constant:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\hbar c \\simeq 0.197~\\text{GeV·fm}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets you convert between energy (GeV) and distance (fm).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Summary**:  \n",
    "Natural units are a bookkeeping trick: by setting $\\hbar=c=1$, we work in the most convenient system for relativistic quantum physics, where energies, masses, and momenta all speak the same language.\n"
